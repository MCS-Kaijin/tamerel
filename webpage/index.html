		<h1 class="centered">Welcome to Tamerel!</h1>
		<p class="centered">Welcome to a dismal world populated by monsters and evil Lords, all governed by the wicked Lich.</p>
		<p>This game does not have your 'classes' or 'races' or anything of the like. Instead you choose which numbers to put into which stats and you play however you like. Be a good Antilord trying to end the Lich's reign of terror, or be a detestable Lord who seeks only their own glory and power. In this game, you choose the fate of Tamerel.</p>
		<h1>Actual game coming soon!</h1>
