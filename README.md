# Tamerel

An open-source MU*. Inspired by Berserk. Made with [Evennia](http://www.evennia.com).
To start, run `source ev/bin/activate; cd tamerel; evennia start`. Then use your favorite MUD client to connect to `127.0.0.1:4000`. Until I figure out how to make this editable, login with Lich:80QYFaTfu0palRw8.
