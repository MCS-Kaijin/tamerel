# Tamerel

An open-source MUx. Inspired by Berserk. Made with [Evennia](http://www.evennia.com).
To run, you must have Python 3.x and Evennia installed, and you should have Evennia installed within a virtual environment. Change directory to `tamerel` and run `evennia migrate; evennia start` then connect to `127.0.0.1:4000` using your favorite MUD client.
